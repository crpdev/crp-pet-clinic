- **_SOLID_** principles
    - _Single responsibility_
        - Every class should have a single responsibility
        - Not more than one reason for a class to change
        - Be cautious not to extend a class more than a page
        - Avoid GOD class
        - When needed, split big classes into smaller ones.
    - _Open-Closed_
        - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
        - Behaviours should be allowed for extension by not modifying it
        - Use private variables with Getter & Setters only when needed
        - Make use of abstract base classes when common functionality is needed
    - _Liskov Substitution Principle_
        - Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program
        - Violations will fail the 'Is A' test
        - Eg: A Square 'Is A' Rectangle, but the vice versa is not true
    - _Interface Segregation Principle_
        - Define Interfaces are specific to a client
        - Client specific Interfaces are better than God Interfaces
        - Encourages minimal dependencies
    - _Dependency Inversion Principle_
        - Abstractions shouldn't depend upon the details
        - Details should depend upon Abstractions
        - Higher & Lower level objects depend on the same abstract interaction
        - Not to be confused with Dependency Injection - where object obtains dependent objects

- Why _SOLID_ Principles in OOP?
    - **_Better Quality Code_**
    - **_Easily Maintainable and Testable_**
    - **_Avoid Tight Coupling in your code_**
